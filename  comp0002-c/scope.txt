File scope - declared in main body
Variable can be used by any function following declaration

Local scope - declared in function
Variable can only be used within its function

Parameter variables can only be used inside functions
Can be considered a kind of local variable

Lifetime of local variable is determined by scope and when memory is allocated
Memory allocated when local scope is entered at runtime
    Deallocated when scope is exited
    Using stack

Lifetime of file scope variable is whole runtime
Memory allocated at start of runtime, deallocated when program ends
Can be used only when name in scope (but memory remains allocated if running different file within program)

Compound statement/block - statement containing list of statements e.g. function
Defines a local scope
Scopes can be nested - can have diff variable of same name in nested block

Global scope - can be achieved using extern (which declares a variable defined in a different file)
Variable can be accessed across the whole program - multiple files
