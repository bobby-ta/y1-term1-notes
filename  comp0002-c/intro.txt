Work through a C textbook over 3-4 weeks
    Read the original C Programming book

Compiler phases
    Tokenisation
    Parsing/grammar checking
    Type checking
    Code generation

Go through intro to Unix on Moodle

gcc options
    -o [name] names output file
    -Wall displays all warnings
    -c generates .o file but not executable (a bunch of .os are assembled into an executable later)
    -S outputs assembly code

gcc can crosscompile code to be run on a diff processor using a diff architecture (e.g. for Arduino, which can't run a compiler itself)
